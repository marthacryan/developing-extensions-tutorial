# Developing Extensions Tutorial
JupyterLab is a modern interactive development environment from Project Jupyter for scientific exploration. Users can install or write third-party extensions to customize or extend JupyterLab, enabling them to, for example, view custom file formats, interact with external services, or display their data (interactive maps, tables, plots, etc.). In this tutorial, attendees will be guided through the process of creating a basic extension and taught about the core components that power JupyterLab. 

## Prerequisites
* Python >= 3.7
* Node.js >= 12 (LTS version preferred)
* (Optional) Note: We'll be using conda as a virtual environment, see [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for instructions on installation of conda

## Tutorial Code
You can find example code in the [examples](https://github.com/marthacryan/developing-extensions-tutorial/tree/main/examples) directory.
